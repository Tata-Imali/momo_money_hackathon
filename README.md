## XRPL Code Structure

### ConfigAndIssue.js

Prerequisite: Create and fund three independent XRPL accounts with XRP using facet.

- **Configure Cold Account Setting (Issuer Account):** Configure the settings for the cold account, which acts as the issuer account for the stablecoin.

- **Configure Hot Account Settings (Capital Pool Account):** Configure the settings for the hot account, which serves as the capital pool account for lending.

- **Create Tust Line:** Establish a trust line from the hot account to the cold account and then from the borrower's account to the hot account.

- **Issue ZAR Stablecoin:** Use the issuer account to issue ZAR stablecoin and transfer it to the hot (capital pool) account.

- **Transfer from Hot to Borrower:** Transfer funds from the hot account to the borrower's account as part of the loan disbursement process.

- **Check Account Balances:** Verify the success of the configuration and transactions by checking the account balances.

### checkRequests.js

In this module:

- The borrower's loan request query is obtained from the Firebase server.

- The borrower's address and requested amount are appended to a transaction from the capital pool account to the borrower's end account. On approval of the loan, the transaction is signed and submitted.

### checkBalance.js

The borrower queries the balance of his iMali-ZAR stablecoin asset associated with his account.

### transferForm.js

The borrower specifies the amount he would like to repay. This amount is then appended to a transaction and transferred from the borrower's account to the capital pool account.
